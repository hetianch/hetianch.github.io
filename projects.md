[Click-Through Rate Prediction](https://github.com/hetianch/Click-Through-Rate) — Used feature hashing to process 45 million rows of data. Reduced memory use by 50% and improved processing speed by 200% as compared with one-hot encoding. Implemented a modified version of online learning method (Per-Coordinate FTRL-Proximal) proposed by a paper through python. Improved training speed by 300% and increased prediction accuracy by 30% as compared with all existing traditional ML models (Boosting, SVM, Logistic, etc ).  



## Academic

[FlyModeller] — Interactive machine learning platform for automatic fly behavior annotation. Built visualization tools by Qt5 and OpenCV, optimized performance by Cython, implemented machine learning features by scikit-learn and autoWeka.
